They ran an EKG and that rapid heart rate was a congenital defect known as Wolfe Parkinson White syndrom. Basically I had an accessory or 2nd electrical system in my heart that would cause a ‚Äúshort circuit‚Äù occasionally and my heart rate would skyrocket. It was cured via a procedure using radio waves to form scar tissue around the accessory node because the impulse could not conduct through the tissue.",
