Therapy doesnâ€™t change unlivable conditions. Poverty is traumatizing. Exploitation is traumatizing. No access to healthcare is traumatizing. Therapy helps you deal with the trauma after the fact. Itâ€™s like a cast for a broken arm. But whatâ€™s the point of casting it if your bones are being rebroken daily?,-0.20000000298023224,3.700000047683716

"All of this, but I can't crash when I get home. I have to be there for my kids. It's also why I have my animals the keep me here, present, and busy too.

Some of us are pretty much just alone without many people to care about us. If I died tomorrow people would care about me way more then they ever did in life and thatâ€™s sad dude and sometimes selfishly makes me idealize the idea of it when Iâ€™m in my most depressed state.,-0.699999988079071,1.399999976158142
"Therapy is great when you're receptive and not depressed, all the tools they teach you are to hemp in the situations that don't stop, breathing, counting, colors, mindfulness..... it all it's great when you're not in the state, a lot of us have been in therapy for years but doesn't change how I can be happy before I got to sleep and wake up emotionally depressed for weeks along with anxiety and all else that comes woth it..... sometimes finding a person or thing to live for is what helps.... in my case my father is what keeps me going when he leaves this earth hopefully I'll find something else",0.6000000238418579,1.2999999523162842

"I met a girl, we instantly hit it off. Everything was perfect and she was my dream girl, even in my wildest imagination I couldnâ€™t think of someone more perfect. Suddenly her ex bf came back into her life, threatened her with suicide if she ignores him, told her his whole family will blame her for his death. I knew the guy and i knew he is a loser and might actually do it. Anyways, i let her get back to him and wanted her to decide if she wants to comeback to me or stay with him. In the end, the guy who created the drama won and she married him 2 years later. I was in severe depression all that time and had 0 interest in anything, it was so hard to bounce back.",-0.10000000149011612,3.9000000953674316
"I was molested as a child, I was bullied in school and grew up in a toxic household. A lot of my early memories are just my parents arguing and my mum getting physically violent with my dad. They both used to bully me for my weight as a kid/teen (I was a little bit chubby but still within the healthy range) and I ended up developing anorexia at 15.
