"I know ‚Äòdid their best‚Äô is lenient. I guess I meant they certainly tried to do the right thing, and in my dad‚Äôs case knew he was failing and showed remorse for it. I wonder if they had had mental help if it would have changed the outcome. I haven‚Äôt read any of the books you‚Äôre all recommending- my whole life I have for the most part tried to avoid non-fiction and heavy topics.

This is exactly why I started doing drugs. Painkillers and meth removed my anxiety and let me feel just normal and able to function around other people. Then one day I got anxiety while high on meth and it never went away while high. And because you're on meth the anxiety gets multiplied by 100. I had to be very careful about what I did around other people because I would be shaking so bad that it would give me away. Literally couldn't hold a pen and write my name.,-0.4000000059604645,4.5
"The pandemic definitely opened the door up for more school avoidance after students learned remotely.

My circumstances were pretty different from those of most however, so I would imagine that for the majority of people the pandemic and even just modern technology probably plays into school avoidance as a whole.",0.0,0.30000001192092896

As a kid I had anxiety and my heart would race. Fast. It felt like a hummingbird in my chest and would abruptly pause and resume a normal pace after a few minutes.At age 23 I had a bad reaction to a tricyclic antidepressant called imipramine and was rushed to the hospital. They ran an EKG and that rapid heart rate was a congenital defect known as Wolfe Parkinson White syndrom. Basically I had an accessory or 2nd electrical system in my heart that would cause a ‚Äúshort circuit‚Äù occasionally and my heart rate would skyrocket. It was cured via a procedure using radio waves to form scar tissue around the accessory node because the impulse could not conduct through the tissue.,0.0,2.0999999046325684
